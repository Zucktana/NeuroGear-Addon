Subject: 🧠 Proposal: Custom Guild Bot "NeuroGear"

I’ve built a custom tool to streamline gear checks and audits.

What it does:

Export: 1-Click in-game export of your gear.

Visual: Displays your gear in Discord with Turtle WoW Database links.

Audit: Automatically compares your gear against our Class BiS lists.

Installation (2 Minutes):

Download the Addon: [Link to your GitHub Repo]

Install: Unzip the folder into TurtleWoW\Interface\AddOns\.

Invite the Bot: [Invite Link]

Source Code: The project is open-source on GitHub for transparency.
